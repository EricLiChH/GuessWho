This libray is being used to transcribe and force align phonemes for
audio files for the Guesswho project. There was code previously written to do
this, however, it is very poorly documented so it is being reimplemented here.

Specifically, this is being built to facilitate the creation of our adaptive
adversary tests.

Please note that due to time constraints this isn't build correctly. Really,
we should read the audio source from memory rather than a file, but since
this needs to be build quickly, I'm going to just implement this library
in the way the original code/the speech recognition library examples are
done.
